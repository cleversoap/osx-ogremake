# OgreMake

[Ogre3D](http://www.ogre3d.org/) is an extraordinary multi-platform rendering engine that focuses on simplicity and flexibility - so why is it always tied to (in my opinion) clunky IDEs?

While the Visual Studio templates are a great starting point for Windows users, OSX has been left out in the cold with nothing but a guide for manual configuration of XCode; the guide itself is great I just don't like working in XCode let alone having to follow those steps each time so, as somebody that lives in Vim, I created a simple Makefile that can be easily edited and extended to get started with Ogre right away on OSX.
